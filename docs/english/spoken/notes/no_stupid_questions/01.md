## necessarily would rather not

```
"necessarily would rather not" 表达的意思是对某事表示不太愿意或不情愿，但并不是必然的。这个短语传达了对某个选择或情况的不太乐意或不情愿，但并非绝对排斥或拒绝的意思。

以下是一些例句来说明 "necessarily would rather not" 的用法：

1. "I necessarily would rather not attend the party, but I feel obligated to go."
（我不太愿意去参加派对，但我感觉有责任去。）

在这些例句中，"necessarily would rather not" 表示对某种选择或情况表示不太愿意，但可能出于其他原因或考虑而接受或采取相应行动。它表达了一种矛盾的心态，既表示不情愿，又承认其他因素的重要性或需要。
